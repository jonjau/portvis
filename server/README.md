This project was bootstrapped with [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/).

> server program. See this repository's main README for more information.

In the project directory, you can run:

## `mvn spring-boot:run`

Runs the program in the development mode.

## `mvn package`

Builds the program for production to the `target` folder.

You can then run the "fat" `.jar` like any other Java application, e.g.

```bash
java -jar portvis-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

There are also other commands, like `mvn clean`, etc.
